**Defintions**

'Crowds' is a dummy variable indicating whether crowds were present at the fixture. Due to the Covid pandemic this has only recently been an issue.

'Neutral venue' is a dummy variable indicating whether the match took place at neither the Home Team or Away Team. Typically this only includes matches like the season final, but may also have included some matches affected by Covid.
